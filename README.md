## Design

### Design Choices

### Colours

The colour scheme for the game was based around classic Battleship and Naval themed colours mixed with a Retro arcade feel:

#### USER INTERFACE

Primary Colours - Grey / Light Grey

Secondary Colours - Red / Green / Blue

<br>

![Colour scheme](docs/features/colour-palette.PNG)

#### PLAYER MESSAGES

The player message text used a supplementary colour scheme of green on black to compliment the Retro Aracde theme.
<br>

![Colour scheme](docs/features/player-message-colour-palette.PNG)

To remain WCAG AAA compliant, I chose dark colour variants for background colours behind white text to maintain maximum contrast. Colour contrast compliance was tested using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Fonts

Black Ops One, Press Start 2P, and Roboto fonts were selected from Google fonts to match the naval and arcade themes of the game while maintaining readability and accessibility.

Black Ops One font is used for the site logo and primary headings. Roboto font used is as the main body text including the navigation, sidebar score text, and footer.

Black Ops One fallback fonts are Lucida Sans Typewriter, Helvetica, and sans-serif.

The Roboto and Press Start 2P fallback fonts are Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif.

Fonts are imported using the Google Fonts library.

### Structure

The pages are structured in an easy-to-navigate z-shaped pattern allowing visitors to quickly consume key information while scanning the page from left to right. Starting at the  top left of the page the visitor will notice the site logo followed by the navigation menu and a Get a Quote call to action button. This allows the user to quickly understand the name of the business, how to navigate the site, and how to get in touch with the site owner to get a quote.

For simplicity, the site consists of one primary page and one helper page, a 404 page. There are ... distinct sections used across the site's pages:

- A header section containing the business logo, a responsive navigation menu and a call to action button

- A footer section which displays the business logo, business tagline, navigation menu, call to action button, navigation links, contact information, social media links, the site owner's name and copyright notice, and a link to the site owner's GitHub page.

## Testing

### HTML Validation

The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to validate the HTML of the website. All pages pass with no errors and no warnings shown.

- index.html [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2F)
- feedback.html [results]()
- 404.html results [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2F404.html)

### CSS Validation

The W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service was used to validate the CSS of the website.

- styles.css [results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2Fassets%2Fcss%2Fstyle.css&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### JavaScript Validation

The JS Hint JavaScript Validation Service was used to validate the JavaScript code on the website. The results below show three code warnings related to "Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics". This was related to code I used to store and retrie click handlers and proved to be a difficult issue to overcome. I'm flaggining hhis for future improvement:

**Metrics**
There are 66 functions in this file.
Function with the largest signature take 8 arguments, while the median is 1.
Largest function has 53 statements in it, while the median is 6.
The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 25 while the median is 2.

**Three warnings**

- 1032	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (currentShip, players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer)
- 1071	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer, currentShip)
- 1567	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (currentShip, players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer, randomShip, clearShips)

### Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards. All pages pass with 0 errors.

- index.html [results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://mat-shepherd.github.io/CI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME/index.html)

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The mobile hamburger menu icon had a small tap target and was difficult to select to open the menu. | The height of the menu button div was set to 100% which was leading to a height of 0px. Setting this to a fixed height of 30px corrected the issue. |
| The original code for the Mobile hamburger menu included a div inside of a label element, which was failing accessibility testing. | I changed the div to a span which passed accessibility tests with no impact on menu functionality. |
| Service containers were different heights which were determined by the amount of content they contained and the width of their parent elements as they flexed across different viewport sizes. | This was corrected by setting the align-self property to stretch for the service-containers class. Credit to the [Same Columns Height](https://flexbox.ninja/demos/same-height-columns/) article by [Geoffrey Crofte at Flexbox Ninja](https://flexbox.ninja/about/) and the [CSS equal height columns](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/css-equal-height-columns/) article by [Chris Bongers at Daily Dev Tips](https://daily-dev-tips.com/about/). |
| The mobile hamburger menu which is driven by pure HTML and CSS uses a checkbox and label element. The label element was empty which was producing an "A form label is present, but does not contain any content" error in the WAVE accessibility test. | This was corrected by adding text inside of a span element within the label element and then using a visually-hidden class and CSS to hide the text from rendering in the browser.

| The parallax sections caused an accessibility warning as they didn't contain a heading tag. | The parallax sections were switch to div instead of section elements. |
| Google Lighthouse flags that several images are not using explicit width and height values which is causing Cumulative Layout Shift which is leading to a slightly reduced performance score. | As I chose to use img srcset to serve different image sizes across various screen size breakpoints along with image lazy loading to improve performance and user experience it wasn't practical to set explicit img widths and heights. A performance score of 98 is a good result and will provide mobile users with a great user experience even on slow mobile connections. Potential workarounds to consider for the future are in [this article](https://dev.to/grahamthedev/quick-tips-how-to-fix-image-elements-do-not-have-explicit-width-and-height-in-page-speed-insights-lighthouse-3776) by [GrahamTheDev](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2702894/grahamthedev) and [this article](https://jakearchibald.com/2022/img-aspect-ratio/) by Jake Archibald(<https://jakearchibald.com/>). |
