## Design

### Design Choices

The aim of this site is to provide the look and feel of the classic Battleship board game with its naval theme, while also conveying a Retro arcade game feel. All images, colours, and sounds were chosen with this aim in mind.

### Colours

The colour scheme for the game was based around classic Battleship and Naval themed colours mixed with a Retro arcade feel:

#### USER INTERFACE

Primary Colours - Grey / Light Grey

Secondary Colours - Red / Green / Blue

<br>

![Colour scheme](docs/features/colour-palette.PNG)

#### PLAYER MESSAGES

The player message text used a supplementary colour scheme of green on black to compliment the Retro Arcade theme.
<br>

![Colour scheme](docs/features/player-message-colour-palette.PNG)

To remain WCAG AAA compliant, I chose dark colour variants for background colours behind white, black, or bright green text to maintain maximum contrast. Colour contrast compliance was tested using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Fonts

Black Ops One, Press Start 2P, and Roboto fonts were selected from Google fonts to match the naval and arcade themes of the game while maintaining readability and accessibility.

Black Ops One font is used for the site logo and primary headings. Roboto font used is as the main body text including the navigation, sidebar score text, and footer.

Black Ops One fallback fonts are Lucida Sans Typewriter, Helvetica, and sans-serif.

The Roboto and Press Start 2P fallback fonts are Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif.

Fonts are imported using the Google Fonts library.

### Structure

The pages are structured in an easy-to-navigate z-shaped pattern allowing visitors to quickly consume key information while scanning the page from left to right. Starting at the top left of the page the visitor will notice the game logo followed by the navigation menu including New Game and How to Play links and an audio toggle icon. This allows the user to quickly understand the name of the game, how to start a new game, how to play, and how to toggle audio on or off.

For simplicity, the site consists of one primary page and two helper pages, a feedback page and a 404 page. There are seven distinct sections used across the site's pages:

#### INDEX PAGE, FEEDBACK PAGE, 404 PAGE

- A header navigation bar containing the game logo followed by the navigation menu including New Game and How to Play links, and an audio toggle icon
  
- A score sidebar (which moves to the footer area on smaller screens) which contains the scores and schips remaining for both players.

- A start game screen, that covers the main game body area, and contains a form to collect the player's name, a start game button and an audio toggle button.
  
- The main game body area which contains the player message container, the player and computer game boards, and the ship placmement controls (whic are hidden once the player has palced thier ships)

- A How to Play modal which conveys the rules of the game and how to play
  
- A win game screen, which is shown when all ships have been sunk, communicating whether the player has won or lost and providing an option to start a new game

- A footer section which displays the business logo, business tagline, navigation menu, call to action button, navigation links, contact information, social media links, the site owner's name and copyright notice, and a link to the site owner's GitHub page.

#### FEEDBACK PAGE

- A feedback screen, that covers the main game body area, and contains a form to collect player feedback, validate form values, show a thank you message on submission, and email the form data to the site owner.

#### 404 PAGE

- A 404 page not found message screen, that covers the main game body area, to let the user know they have entered an incorrect URL and provide them with a New Game button to navigate back to the game index page.

## Features

The website consists of three pages in total, an index page, afeedback page, and a 404 page. The site's pages contain ... distinct features:

### Existing Features

- the header and footer navigation remains consistent with the index page design and all internal navigation links on this page will direct the user back to the index page.
- User stories covered:

![Footer Section](docs/features/404-page.webp)

### Features Left to Implement

The following features could be implemented in the future to provide users with more detailed information and further build prospective client trust through the website:

- I purposefully didn't hyperlink the logo to the index page to avoid a user clicking on it and losing their game progress. A click listener could be added to the logo and function added to warn the user before abandoning a game in progress.
- A 'smarter' computer opponenent could be implemented which would take random shots within a close range of a previous hit shout if that shot didn't result in sinking a ship. Currently the computer takes completely random shots within the bounds of the game grid, avoiding coordiantes that ahve a lready been shot on.
- With the ability to make the computer opponent 'smarter', a game difficulty feature could be added to let the user choose how difficult they want the game to be.
- I added an attribute for direction to ship objects with the intention of adding a flying plane animation when shots are taken. Knowing if a ship is vertical or horizontal and it's coordinates would allow a plane image to be animated horizontally or vertically across the board to match the ships rotation. Otherwise the plane would randomlyfly horizontally or vertically across the board if the shot was a miss.

## Testing

### HTML Validation

The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to validate the HTML of the website. All pages pass with no errors and no warnings shown.

- index.html [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2F)
- feedback.html [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2Ffeedback.html)
- 404.html results [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2F404.html)

### CSS Validation

The W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service was used to validate the CSS of the website.

- styles.css [results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2Fassets%2Fcss%2Fstyle.css&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### JavaScript Validation

The JS Hint JavaScript Validation Service was used to validate the JavaScript code on the website. The results below show three code warnings related to "Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics". This was related to code I used to store and retrie click handlers and proved to be a difficult issue to overcome. I'm flaggining hhis for future improvement:

**Metrics**
There are 66 functions in this file.
Function with the largest signature take 8 arguments, while the median is 1.
Largest function has 53 statements in it, while the median is 6.
The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 25 while the median is 2.

**Three warnings**

- 1032	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (currentShip, players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer)
- 1071	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer, currentShip)
- 1567	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (currentShip, players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer, randomShip, clearShips)

### Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards. All pages pass with 0 errors.

- index.html [results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://mat-shepherd.github.io/CI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME/index.html)
- feedback.html [results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://mat-shepherd.github.io/CI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME/feedback.html)
- 404.html results [results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://mat-shepherd.github.io/CI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME/404.html)

### Performance

Google Lighthouse in Google's Chrome Developer Tools was used to test the performance of the website. All elements performed well with peformance scores above 90, accessiblity and SEO scores of 100, and best rpactice scores in the 90 to 100 range. The 404 page had a 92 best practice score for some lower clarity images but these are ship and fire icons which are samll by design.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The mobile hamburger menu icon had a small tap target and was difficult to select to open the menu. | The height of the menu button div was set to 100% which was leading to a height of 0px. Setting this to a fixed height of 30px corrected the issue. |
| The original code for the Mobile hamburger menu included a div inside of a label element, which was failing accessibility testing. | I changed the div to a span which passed accessibility tests with no impact on menu functionality. |
| Service containers were different heights which were determined by the amount of content they contained and the width of their parent elements as they flexed across different viewport sizes. | This was corrected by setting the align-self property to stretch for the service-containers class. Credit to the [Same Columns Height](https://flexbox.ninja/demos/same-height-columns/) article by [Geoffrey Crofte at Flexbox Ninja](https://flexbox.ninja/about/) and the [CSS equal height columns](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/css-equal-height-columns/) article by [Chris Bongers at Daily Dev Tips](https://daily-dev-tips.com/about/). |
| The mobile hamburger menu which is driven by pure HTML and CSS uses a checkbox and label element. The label element was empty which was producing an "A form label is present, but does not contain any content" error in the WAVE accessibility test. | This was corrected by adding text inside of a span element within the label element and then using a visually-hidden class and CSS to hide the text from rendering in the browser. Credit to [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71369523/21643967) by [GrahamTheDev](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2702894/grahamthedev). |
| The parallax sections caused an accessibility warning as they didn't contain a heading tag. | The parallax sections were switch to div instead of section elements. |
| Google Lighthouse flags that several images are not using explicit width and height values which is causing Cumulative Layout Shift which is leading to a slightly reduced performance score. | As I chose to use img srcset to serve different image sizes across various screen size breakpoints along with image lazy loading to improve performance and user experience it wasn't practical to set explicit img widths and heights. A performance score of 98 is a good result and will provide mobile users with a great user experience even on slow mobile connections. Potential workarounds to consider for the future are in [this article](https://dev.to/grahamthedev/quick-tips-how-to-fix-image-elements-do-not-have-explicit-width-and-height-in-page-speed-insights-lighthouse-3776) by [GrahamTheDev](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2702894/grahamthedev) and [this article](https://jakearchibald.com/2022/img-aspect-ratio/) by Jake Archibald(<https://jakearchibald.com/>). |
