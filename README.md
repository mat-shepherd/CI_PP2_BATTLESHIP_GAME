## Design

### Design Choices

The aim of this site is to provide the look and feel of the classic Battleship board game with its naval theme, while also conveying a Retro arcade game feel. All images, colours, and sounds were chosen with this aim in mind.

### Colours

The colour scheme for the game was based around classic Battleship and Naval themed colours mixed with a Retro arcade feel:

#### USER INTERFACE

Primary Colours - Grey / Light Grey

Secondary Colours - Red / Green / Blue

<br>

![Colour scheme](docs/features/colour-palette.PNG)

#### PLAYER MESSAGES

The player message text used a supplementary colour scheme of green on black to compliment the Retro Arcade theme.
<br>

![Colour scheme](docs/features/player-message-colour-palette.PNG)

To remain WCAG AAA compliant, I chose dark colour variants for background colours behind white, black, or bright green text to maintain maximum contrast. Colour contrast compliance was tested using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Fonts

Black Ops One, Press Start 2P, and Roboto fonts were selected from Google fonts to match the naval and arcade themes of the game while maintaining readability and accessibility.

Black Ops One font is used for the site logo and primary headings. Roboto font used is as the main body text including the navigation, sidebar score text, and footer.

Black Ops One fallback fonts are Lucida Sans Typewriter, Helvetica, and sans-serif.

The Roboto and Press Start 2P fallback fonts are Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif.

Fonts are imported using the Google Fonts library.

### Structure

The pages are structured in an easy-to-navigate z-shaped pattern allowing visitors to quickly consume key information while scanning the page from left to right. Starting at the top left of the page the visitor will notice the game logo followed by the navigation menu including New Game and How to Play links and an audio toggle icon. This allows the user to quickly understand the name of the game, how to start a new game, how to play, and how to toggle audio on or off.

For simplicity, the site consists of one primary page and two helper pages, a feedback page and a 404 page. There are seven distinct sections used across the site's pages:

#### INDEX PAGE, FEEDBACK PAGE, 404 PAGE

- A header navigation bar containing the game logo followed by the navigation menu including New Game and How to Play links, and an audio toggle icon
  
- A score sidebar (which moves to the footer area on smaller screens) which contains the scores and schips remaining for both players.

- A start game screen, that covers the main game body area, and contains a form to collect the player's name, a start game button and an audio toggle button.
  
- The main game body area which contains the player message container, the player and computer gameboard grids, and the ship placmement controls (which are hidden once the player has placed thier ships)

- A How to Play modal which conveys the rules of the game and how to play
  
- A win game screen, which is shown when all ships have been sunk, communicating whether the player has won or lost and providing an option to start a new game

- A footer section which displays the business logo, business tagline, navigation menu, call to action button, navigation links, contact information, social media links, the site owner's name and copyright notice, and a link to the site owner's GitHub page.

#### FEEDBACK PAGE

- A feedback screen, that covers the main game body area, and contains a form to collect player feedback, validate form values, show a thank you message on submission, and email the form data to the site owner.

#### 404 PAGE

- A 404 page not found message screen, that covers the main game body area, to let the user know they have entered an incorrect URL and provide them with a New Game button to navigate back to the game index page.

### Features Left to Implement

The following features could be implemented in the future to provide users with more detailed information and further build prospective client trust through the website:

- I purposefully didn't hyperlink the logo to the index page to avoid a user clicking on it and losing their game progress. A click listener could be added to the logo and function added to warn the user before abandoning a game in progress.
- A 'smarter' computer opponenent could be implemented which would take random shots within a close range of a previous hit shout if that shot didn't result in sinking a ship. Currently the computer takes completely random shots within the bounds of the game grid, avoiding coordiantes that ahve a lready been shot on.
- With the ability to make the computer opponent 'smarter', a game difficulty feature could be added to let the user choose how difficult they want the game to be.
- I added an attribute for direction to ship objects with the intention of adding a flying plane animation when shots are taken. Knowing if a ship is vertical or horizontal and it's coordinates would allow a plane image to be animated horizontally or vertically across the board to match the ships rotation. Otherwise the plane would randomlyfly horizontally or vertically across the board if the shot was a miss.

## Testing

### HTML Validation

The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to validate the HTML of the website. All pages pass with no errors and no warnings shown.

- index.html [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2F)
- feedback.html [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2Ffeedback.html)
- 404.html results [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2F404.html)

### CSS Validation

The W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service was used to validate the CSS of the website.

- styles.css [results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmat-shepherd.github.io%2FCI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME%2Fassets%2Fcss%2Fstyle.css&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### JavaScript Validation

The JS Hint JavaScript Validation Service was used to validate the JavaScript code on the website. The results below show three code warnings related to "Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics". This was related to code I used to store and retrie click handlers and proved to be a difficult issue to overcome. I'm flaggining hhis for future improvement:

**Metrics**
There are 66 functions in this file.
Function with the largest signature take 8 arguments, while the median is 1.
Largest function has 53 statements in it, while the median is 6.
The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 25 while the median is 2.

**Three warnings**

- 1032	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (currentShip, players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer)
- 1071	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer, currentShip)
- 1567	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (currentShip, players, playerShips, computerShips, gameBoards, currentPlayer, randomShip, clearShips)

### Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards. All pages pass with 0 errors.

- index.html [results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://mat-shepherd.github.io/CI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME/index.html)
- feedback.html [results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://mat-shepherd.github.io/CI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME/feedback.html)
- 404.html results [results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://mat-shepherd.github.io/CI_PP2_BATTLESHIP_GAME/404.html)

### Performance

Google Lighthouse in Google's Chrome Developer Tools was used to test the performance of the website. All elements performed well with peformance scores above 90, accessiblity and SEO scores of 100, and best rpactice scores in the 90 to 100 range. The 404 page had a 92 best practice score for some lower clarity images but these are ship and fire icons which are samll by design.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Gameboard layout on mobile devices | Due to the square nature and required size of the grids to be able to interact with indivudal cells, responsive layout was tricky and led to horizontal overflow on small screens, poor spacing of elements on mobile devices, and a poor responsive user experience. To correct this I set the gameboard area to column layout below 1600px breakpoint and reduced the size of the ships grids cells to half the size of those on desktop. I then set the ship and icon images to a % based width to make them respond to the gaemboard grid cell size. |
| Scrolling on mobile devices | Due to column layout on small screens the player would have to scroll and up and down the screen when taking turns to understand what the computer player did during their turn and to take their shot. As Player message pulls focus to the top of the screen when it updates this was creating a very poor user experience. To crrect this I added a gameboard-reverse class to the gaemboard div in the checkTurn function. Adding this class changes the order of the flex positioned gameboard grids, which allows the active grid to always show at the top of the gameboard. This also keeps the player viewing the top of the viewport and minimises jumping back to the top of the screen when the player message updates. |
|  Rotating grid cells would rotate hit and miss icons | The functions which rotate ship images on the gameboard actually rotate the containing div by multipls of 90 degrees to ensure the image pivots around the center of the cell the ship was placed in. This worked well but created an issue where ship hit or miss icons when added to the original ship placement cell were also rotated, which looked odd and inconsistent with icons show elsewhere on the board. To fix this I ntroduced a check into functions which add ship hit or miss icons to see if the parent div class contained transform. If it did the icon image would then be rotated -90 degrees. |
|  Player message timing |  As the game progresses through each player's turn it proveed tricky to slow down gameplay and ensure that player messages were visible long enough to read before they were replaced by the next player message. While this is not fully resolved to my liking I introduced setTimeoutet functions aroun player messages to add delays before they are shown to give the previous message time to display. When ships are sunk it provde very difficult to give the message time to display. With help from an approach provided by ChatGPT I introduced a delay function and a promise object to delay gameplay to give this ship sunk message time to display before gamplay resumes. |
| Deleting grid click listeners | Each player grid allows the user to inidcate the cells they will place ships in or take shots on by adding click listeners when grids are created and disabling click listeners when it is the computer's turn or a grid location is occupied by a ship or a shot. Removing click listeners was a difficult issue to solve as each cell's click listener was specific to it and a reference to the specific listenenr had to be stored somewhere for later retrieval to remove the correct listener for the correct grid and cell. With guodance from ChatGPT I decided to store the place and shoot event listeners in attributes of the Gameboard object so I could loop through the relevant gameboard's placeEventHandlers or shootEventHandlers to find the click listener for relevant grid cell. This worked well but I still had an issue where I need to disable all grid listeners on the opposing player's grids to ensure the player couldn't randomly trigger unexpected functions. The quick fix for this was found in an article by Coding Deft, which led to the addition of a style to gameboard grid elements that set pointer-events: none on the on-active gameboard grid during checkTurn. |
| Poor page load on mobile devices  | On testing the game index page with Lighthouse I was receving a perfomance score in the 70s, largely due to the loading and rendering of the repeating ocean tile gif in the background of the gameboard. I exploed multiple options including replacing this with a video of the effect but in the end settled on using a lazy loading approach. A lazyLoadBackground function was provided by chatGPT and dapted to make the ocean tile background load only when initPlacement was called to start rendering the gameboards. This greatly improved page load performance on mobiles with scores in the 90s.|
