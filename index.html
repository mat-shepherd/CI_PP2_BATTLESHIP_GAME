                        <h2>BATTLESHIP GAME RULES</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to my Battleship Game which I developed as my JavaScript project
                            while studying at the Code Institute. Learn the game rules and how to play below!</p>
                        <h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>
                        <p>This is a game turn based strategy game against the computer. Each player has 5 ships
                            in their fleet of varying sizes. Ships are placed on the game board but neither player
                            can see eachother's ships. Each player then takes turn taking shots on eachother's ships.
                            When a player sinks all 5 of their opponent's ships they win!
                        </p>
                        <h4>SHIP FLEETS</h4>
                        <p>Each player commands a fleet of 5 ships:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CARRIER: 5 CELLS LONG</li>
                            <li>BATTLESHIP: 4 CELLS LONG</li>
                            <li>CRUISER: 3 CELLS LONG</li>
                            <li>SUBMARINE: 3 CELLS LONG</li>
                            <li>DESTROYER: 2 CELLS LONG</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>PLACING SHIPS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Click on a square in the game board grid labelled with your name to place a ship.</li>
                            <li>Using the ship placement controls, click the ROTATE button to rotate a ship 90 degrees.
                            </li>
                            <li>When you are happy with your ship's placement click the PLACE button using the ship
                                placement controls. You will then move on to placing your next ship repeating the
                                process
                                above until all five of your ships are placed.</li>
                            <li>If you want to reset your ship postions click the CLEAR ALL button using the ship
                                placement controls.</li>
                            <li>If you want to randomly place all of your ships and start the game right away, click the
                                RANDOM button using the ship placement controls.</li>
                            <li>You can place each ship in any horizontal or vertical position but not diagonally.</li>
                            <li>Don't place a ship so that any part of it overlaps letters, numbers, the edge of the
                                grid,
                                or another ship. If you do the game will ask you to place the ship again by click on the
                                grid.</li>
                            <li>You can't change the position of any ships once the game has begun.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>GAME PLAY</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once all ships are placed, you and the computer will alternate taking shots on
                                eachother's
                                game boards. You will take the first shot.</li>
                            <li>Take a shot by hovering over Player Two's game board and clicking on a grid location.
                            </li>
                            <li>Once a shot has been taken, you will see an explosion at a ship grid location if a shot
                                was
                                hit or a splash if the shot missed.</li>
                            <li>If a ship is hit at all of its grid locations it will be sunk i.e. 5 hits on a carrier
                                will sink the ship. A sunk ship will have explosion markers along it's entire length.
                            </li>
                            <li>When you hit a computer ship you will see an explosion marker at the guessed ship grid
                                location. When it's your turn you the try and guess the next location the ship could be
                                located at.</li>
                            <li>You won't see a computer's ship until you have hit it at all of its grid locations.</li>
                            <li>You can track which ships are sunk, which are still afloat, and each player's score
                                (number of games won) in the 'SCORES' area.</li>
                            <li>When a player sinks all 5 of their opponent's ships they win!</li>
                            <li>If you want to play again click the NEW GAME button in the winner message area or using
                                the link at the top of the screen.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY!</p>
